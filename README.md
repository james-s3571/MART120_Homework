# Final Project Proposal and Final Project Log


# Final Project Proposal
I plan to make a platformer with a dinosaur as the playable character. My idea isn't 100% planned out yet, as I want the game to stay flexible for p5.js. I aim to experiment with p5.js and find out how it will shape my game.

#Final Project Log
/
I started out by thinking that I wanted my game to be a platformer. I looked through tutorials and found a series that discussed how to make a simple platformer. I followed and my game was coming along well until I had to make the platforms. I followed the code, but I could never get them to work right. They work, but they have some invisible areas that I was never able to fix. It didn't help that the tutorial used a different program to code than I was. It must've ran it differently because the platforms in the videos worked well. This frustrated me for a while, but I accepted it. I also would try to implement a new idea and it would break something else in my code. I am proud of the game I created, but it's a shell of what I imagined it was going to be before starting the project. I think I may have bit off more than I could chew though, as I worked on the game for a while and couldn't get it to where I wanted it to be.
