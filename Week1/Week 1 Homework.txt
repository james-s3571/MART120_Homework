	CLI's or Client User Interfaces allow users to interact with a system by inputting commands. A CLI will take a command from a user and run the command through a system to give the desired effect. GUIs or Graphical User Interfaces allow users to interact with a system through icons rather than text. An example of a GUI would be Apple's Safari. The browser is easy to interact with, as users interact with it through simple buttons. CLIs are stronger than GUIs, as CLIs run through a piece of hardware. CLI's are also more efficient because the commands are the only request of the user. The tradeoff is that CLIs take more effort to learn and have become less commonplace. These interfaces also demand the user to memorize many different commands. This does allow for CLIs to be more efficient with speed and memory. GUIs have to remember all of their functions and take up more room because of it. GUIs are much more common now due to being simple to use.  GUI's have been utilized by most devices because they are so simple.  GUI's are better for common machines, but for more complex demands, CLIs are the better option.
