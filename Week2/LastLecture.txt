	The Last Lecture was an interesting video and has made me rethink and assess my past and future. I enjoyed the lecture, and the emotion behind it added a lot. For me, the lecture brought up some great points. One of my favorite points was that a person living a good life will see success reflected in their personal life. I have always tried to be a good person, whether I’m at school, home, or out. I believe that this has aided me in success in school and work. I was really moved by how Randy Pausch was so passionate about his field of work. I really enjoyed listening to him describe what he did at the University because he was so happy to do so. I connected with the statement that people will impress you with given time. I find it difficult not to define a person by my first interaction with them, but I tend to do so. This often results in me being very easily surprised by them because people can’t be defined by one interaction. One idea in the speech that I found myself disagreeing with was that a person should never complain. I agree that complaining for the sake of complaining is unproductive. Yet, if a person is “complaining” about something with a serious impact on them, then they should be listened to. Overall though, I found the presentation to be very moving. I also found myself agreeing and connecting with the statements made by Randy Pausch. The combination of the seriousness mixed with the humor made the speech really work for me.
