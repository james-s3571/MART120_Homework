In my opinion, learning styles have a huge influence on how we learn. I am a visual learner, and that certainly applies to my style. I learn through watching something being done. Sadly, in my experience of high school, learning styles aren't utilized. If learning styles had been identified and used more often, then I think more students would enjoy learning in school. Learning styles could be a tool that schools utilize to help teach students. Since schools don't use these styles, students can certainly learn what their style is. Then they can modify their work or study technique to better match what style they fall under.
